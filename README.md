# Hangman-Game
A Python-coded Hangman game. The game prompts the player for their name and then starts the game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and displays it as a series of underscores representing the letters. The player can guess letters one at a time to uncover the word.

If the player's guess is correct, the corresponding underscore(s) are replaced with the guessed letter. If the guess is incorrect, a hangman figure is displayed, and the player is informed of the remaining guesses. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.

The game includes a loop that allows the player to play again or exit after completing a game. The hangman figure is displayed using ASCII art stored in a list.
